Shifterator
===========

Shifterator is a Python package for visualizing pairwise comparisons between texts through *word shifts*, a general method for extracting *which* words contribute to a difference between two texts and, importantly, *how* they do so. These contributions are visualized through *word shift graphs*, detailed and interpretable horizontal bar charts that display the interacting components of word shifts. Shifterator can be used for direct text comparisons, sentiment analysis, or as a scientifically sound alternative to a word cloud.

Features
--------

Shifterator:

- Provides interpretable tools for working with text as data and mapping the complexities of how two texts are similar or different.
- Implements common text comparison measures, including relative frequency, Shannon entropy, Tsallis entropy, the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and the Jensen-Shannon divergence.
- Unpacks weighted averages calculated from any dictionary-based sentiment analysis method.
- Diagnoses data artifacts and measurement errors early in the research process.
- Produces publication-ready visualizations of word shift graphs that provide detailed summaries of text comparison measures.
- Removes the need to ever make a word cloud for a scientific publication.

Computational social scientists, digital humanists, and other text analysis practitioners can all use Shifterator to construct reliable, robust, and interpretable stories from text data.
